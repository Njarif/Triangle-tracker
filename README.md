## Description
The website is a triangle tracker that allows users to identify what type of triangle they have using the 3 lengths present in a triangle. The user inputs 3 values in the three prompts (x,y,z) and the website tells them whether the values would be viable for an isosceles triangle, an equilateral triangle, a scalene triangle or wouldn't make a triangle at all(not a triangle). The user is required to input 3 numerical values (the three sides of the triangle and the website will tell them what kind of a triangle it is and explain why as well.) However as of now the website can only identify three types of triangle (an isosceles triangle, an equilateral triangle, a scalene triangle) and also tell a user if the values can't form a triangle. Future iterations should have more capabilities on this feature.It's also important to note that the values a user inputs have to be in numeric form and can't be in alphanumeric or alphabetic form. In short the user has to enter numbers and can't put numbers in the form of words(an example would be "thirty") as this will not work for now.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
<<<<<<< HEAD
There aren't any known bugs as of yet but if you come across any bugs please feel free to reach out to me and I'll be more than happy to fix them.
=======
The website as of now prompts the user immediately the land on it or when they reload the page instead of when they submit their values. I am working on fixing this as soon as possible using jQuery. Expect updates soon.

## Technologies Used
I used basic HTML, CSS and Javascript up until this point but there are more changes on the way.I expect to incorporate jQuery for the forms to work.
