      <ul>
        <li>The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always larger than the length of the third side.</li>
        <li>Triangles are becoming used more in construction. They are harder to use than rectangles, but can be stronger and may be more resistant to earthquakes.</li>
        <li>If you draw a line in a rectangle from far corner to corner you cut the rectangle into two right triangles.</li>
        <li>If you know two of the angles in a triangle, you can always figure out the third because they must add up to 180 degrees.</li>
        <li>The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always longer than the third side.</li>
        <li>The triangle and two is a type of defense used in basketball.</li>
